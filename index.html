        <h2 class="begin">The jellyfish that never dies</h2>
        <br/>
        <p class="volume1">Humans have always been fascinated by the idea of cheating death. We’ve looked to everything from religion, the planets, cryogenics and even the mythical fountain of youth. While we were searching the heavens, science and all the corners of the Earth, the secret of immortality may have been floating in the ocean this whole time. In the form of a jellyfish. When we think of a jellyfish, what most of us is picturing is the “Medusa stage”, the second stage of jellyfish life. They spend this part of their lives as opaque drifting balloons with trailing tentacles.
            <br />
            <br />
            If the start of jellyfish life wasn’t extraordinary enough, its death is where things get really exciting. When the medusa the immortal jellyfish (Turritopsis dohrnii) dies, it sinks to the ocean floor and begins to decay. Amazingly, its cells then reaggregate, not into a new medusa, but into polyps, and from these polyps emerge new jellyfish. The jellyfish has skipped to an earlier life stage to begin again.
            <br />
            <br />
            The lifespan of a Greenland shark: up to 500 years. The giant barrel sponge: over 2,000 years. But the longest-living animal on planet Earth? The immortal jellyfish, a creature that can seemingly escape from death altogether.

        <h2 class="lifespan">How does the immortal jellyfish live forever?</h2>
        <br/>
        <p class="volume2">To understand how the immortal jellyfish is able to hack its lifecycle, you first have to dive into how a normal jellyfish ages. Don’t worry, it’s fairly simple. Albeit very very strange.
            <br />
            <br />
            Normally, a mere mortal jellyfish passes through five stages of life:</p>
            
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Fertilised egg: an adult jellyfish (known as a medusa) will spawn eggs and sperm into the water, with these two types of cells joining up to create a fertilised egg.</li>
                <br />
                <li>Planula: the fertilised egg grows into a small larva called a planula. It looks something like a microscopic worm and can swim about freely.</li>
                <br />
                <li>Polyp: The planula will swim down to find a solid surface (such as a seabed), where it will develop a digestive system and is able to feed itself. When conditions such as water temperature suit it, the polyp will reproduce asexually, cloning itself to create a small colony.</li>
                <br />
                <li>Ephyra: after forming a new set of muscles and nerves, a section of a polyp (either the original polyp or clone) becomes an ephyra, an organism that can swim independently, grow and feed.</li>
                <br />
                <li>Medusa: this is a fully-grown adult jellyfish, which can reproduce sexually with another jellyfish (usually dying shortly afterwards).</li>
            </ol>
